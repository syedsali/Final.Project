                <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Introduction</b></h2><br>
                <p>Many people do not understand the importance of physical fitness and maintaining good health,
                    therefore
                    they
                    ignore physical fitness and activities which then could lead to life threatening conditions such as
                    heart
                    disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and many more. By enduring daily physical activities, you are
                    not
                    only
                    improving the state and condition of your body, but your state of mind as well. This can benefit
                    your
                    mental
                    state of mind by improving your confidence, and make you feel overall better about yourself and your
                    looks.To
                    put it simply, physical activity and exercise is important for everyone. Children, adolescents, and
                    adults of
                    all ages need regular physical activity. Physical activity promotes good health, and you should stay
                    active
                    throughout all stages of your life regardless of your body type or BMI.Understanding the benefits of
                    physical
                    fitness and knowing how active you should be can help you maintain good health and improve your
                    overall. </p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Improve Your Health</b></h2><br>
                <p>There are numerous health advantages to physical fitness. Regular exercise and physical activity
                    promotes strong muscles and bones. It improves respiratory, cardiovascular health, and overall
                    health. Staying active can also help you maintain a healthy weight, reduce your risk for type 2
                    diabetes, heart disease, and reduce your risk for some cancers.

                    In other words, staying active is a crucial part of maintaining good health and wellness.

                    Here are the CDC physical activity guidelines for children, adults, adults over 65, and pregnant or
                    postpartum women.

                    Encourage your family to be more active, and challenge yourself to meet daily or weekly physical
                    activity goals. Play outdoor sports with the whole family, schedule time each day to go to the gym,
                    or pick up healthy, active hobbies like hiking or cycling. National Physical Fitness and Sports
                    Month is a great time to get more active, but don’t stop at the end of the month. Make exercise and
                    physical activity a permanent part of your daily routine!</p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Results</b></h2> <br>
                <p>The heart is a muscle, and as you get fitter, your it will become stronger. This leads to an
                    increased stroke volume, which means your heart will pump more blood per beat than before. This can,
                    in turn, decrease your resting heart rate.

                    Resting heart rate can decrease by up to 1 beat/min in sedentary individuals with each week of
                    aerobic training, at least for a few weeks. Other studies have shown smaller reductions with fewer
                    than 5 beats following up to 20 weeks of aerobic training.

                    Your maximum heart rate typically stays unchanged with regular training and is more likely to
                    decrease over time as part of the normal ageing process.Within three to six months, an individual
                    can see a 25 to 100% improvement in their muscular fitness – providing a regular resistance program
                    is followed.

                    Most of the early gains in strength are the result of the neuromuscular connections learning how to
                    produce movement. Sometimes accounting for up to 50% of strength improvements in the early stages of
                    a strength-based program. </p>

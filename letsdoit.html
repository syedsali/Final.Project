                <p class="card-text">“People tend to think of cardio in terms of steady state exercise, like jogging,”
                    says Trevor Thieme, C.S.C.S. and Openfit’s senior manager of fitness and nutrition content. “But
                    really, cardio is anything that A) raises your heart and breathing rates, and B) improves the
                    function of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system.”<br>Cardio training can be a steady-state
                    exercise that’s done at low to moderate intensity, like jogging or an easy bike ride. Cardio
                    training can also be intervals of high intensity exercise, like HIIT, where you go all out for
                    20-120 second bursts, and then rest just long enough to allow you to perform the next round with
                    equal intensity (like tabata).<br> <br> <a

                <p class="card-text"> Healthy food refers to food that contains the right amount of nutrients to keep
                    our body fit. We need healthy food to keep ourselves fit. Furthermore, healthy food is also very
                    delicious as opposed to popular thinking. Nowadays, kids need to eat healthy food more than ever. We
                    must encourage good eating habits so that our future generations will be healthy and fit.

                    Most importantly, the harmful effects of junk food and the positive impact of healthy food must be
                    stressed upon. People should teach kids from an early age about the same.Healthy food does not have
                    merely one but numerous benefits. It helps us in various spheres of life. Healthy food does not only
                    impact our physical health but mental health too. <br> <br> <a
